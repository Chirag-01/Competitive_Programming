# Problem Statement: Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example 1:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90469613/195169741-e9d96dd8-59d3-4bbb-87fa-0e4fbfdb64b2.png)

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

## Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

## Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105
