# Problem Statement: Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 
## Example 1:

- Input: nums = [2,2,1]
- Output: 1

## Example 2:

- Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
- Output: 4

## Example 3:

- Input: nums = [1]
- Output: 1
 

## Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
- -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
